# Abstract.
abstract = "The invention provides a path planning method and system for a logistics system, which is applicable to a logistics system composed of multiple robots. The method includes: constructing a system preset model according to system characteristics; the robot is initialized; and the robot acquires task instructions Then execute the transfer procedure until the task instruction is completed. The path planning method and system of the logistics system provided by the present invention can better ensure the reliability and credibility of the established logistics system model. The distributed path coordination method is adopted to greatly reduce the computational complexity. Makes the path planning method more flexible and compatible; and can better solve the common collision problems and deadlock problems in logistics systems, and has strong practicability."
